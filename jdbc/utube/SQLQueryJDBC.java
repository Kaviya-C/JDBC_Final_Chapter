	 * Life Cycle of SQL query execution
	 * 
	 * Java application use jdbc to send the sql query to db
	 * 
	 * by using statement object we can send the sql query to database
	 * 
	 * this query go to database engine
	 * 
	 * here two parts there one is compilation and execution
	 * 
	 * in compilation there are three works
	 * 
	 * tokenization ---seperate as tokens like select,from,where,* like this
	 * 
	 * query table generated
	 * 
	 * pass into parsing--- check the syntax
	 * 
	 * query optimization -- optimize the code
	 * 
	 * everything fine went to compilation
	 * 
	 * compilation to execution
	 * 
	 * then send back to database engine
	 * 
	 * finally send to java application
